# FreeMBT
The Freeciv Modpack Builder's Toolkit 
FreeMBT is a Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) for creating new Modpacks (Rulesets) for Freeciv. This software is pre-alpha, and has a long way to go at this point.  (1 April 2015)

I am currently working on the unit creation area, allowing you to easily build and modify the various types of units 
for the game. This is only one small piece of a new ruleset, and it is a complex web. Each piece depends on many others. 

If you are interested in helping out, have questions, or for any other reason need to get a hold of me, 
drop me a line here:
